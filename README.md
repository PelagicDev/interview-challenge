# Interview Challenge

We generated this folder with a create-react-app script.

We also used the json-server node package to create a mock web server.

Run the mock server with the command 'npm run start_mock_server' or 'yarn start_mock_server';

Create a react app that obey the following requirements:
 * If the react app starts then make a restful api call to http://localhost:3000/movie and grab list of movies provided in our sample data
 * If you recieve the list of movies from the restful api then display the title of movies on the screen
 * If you display the movie titles then make each movie clickable
 * If you click click on the movie title then show the details somewhere on the screen

You may use any npm packages to do this challenge.

Please focus on code organization and readability.
